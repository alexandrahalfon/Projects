Project: **Hypothesis testing of movie ratings data**

Purpose: 
  In this project, I perform hypothesis testing on a dataset that stems from a replication attempt of published research (Wallisch & Whritner,2017). 
  The goal of this data analysis is to unveil insights that might help a movie studio optimize their operations. 

Dataset description: 
This dataset features ratings data of 400 movies from 1097 research participants.
  1st row: Headers (Movie titles/questions) â€“ note that the indexing in this list is from 1
  Row 2-1098: Responses from individual participants
  Columns 1-400: These columns contain the ratings for the 400 movies (0 to 4, and missing)
  Columns 401-421: These columns contain self-assessments on sensation seeking behaviors (1-5)
  Columns 422-464: These columns contain responses to personality questions (1-5)
  Columns 465-474: These columns contain self-reported movie experience ratings (1-5)
  Column 475: Gender identity (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described)
  Column 476: Only child (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response)
  Column 477: Movies are best enjoyed alone (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response)
